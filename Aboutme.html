                <p>Let me tell you a bit about myself. Having degrees in both Illustration at VCU & Software Engineering at Strayer (finishing top of my class), I have brought both passions together. With a strong skill set in Object Oriented Programming, specializing in Java and Javascript, I can create dynamic programs and web applications. A family man at heart, all of my ambitions are driven in the betterment of our lives. A native of Richmond VA, my wife and I own a house in Randolph, where we spend our days enjoying the city we love so much.</p>

                <p >  I spent the first 15 years of my professional life as a wedding photographer and bartender. This has helped me excel at the soft skills that so many developers lack in today's market.
                     When I told my wife that I wanted to back to school in my 30's she was so supportive. I searched through quite a few colleges until I found that Strayer was a good fit for me.
                     Having had gone to an online school I learned just how important time management is, and learned to plan out everything, which not only has helped me in my professional life, but also in my personal life.

                     On weekends my family and I enjoy going hiking and camping at any of the wonderful parks around Virginia. I like filling my free time during the week with painting models, playing Dungeon and Dragons along with other board games, and going for walks around the city.

                            <p class="text-center">A simple RGB color game which was my very first JavaScript project. It was also the project that made me realize just how much I love front-end engineering.
                                RGB is the light color spectrum, Red Green and Blue. At the top a random color is shown in the RGB form. {example RGB(255,49,65)} The goal of the game is to guess the color the numbers makes.
